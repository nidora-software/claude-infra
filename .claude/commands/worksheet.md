# Create new worksheet task

- Look for the tasks has been done since the CURRENT MONTH to the CURRENT DAY including TODAY.
- Generate a 2 column table, include header DAY and TASK column titles. First column will be displaying date in format `dd-MM-YYYY` and the second will be displaying what's been done in that day just in ONE SENTENCE.
- Do not directly use commit messages, instead rewrite them in a comprehensive way but don't overcomplicate neither do oversimplify.
- Each day should have some value, if it's empty on that day then use the day closest with multiple commits, distribute those messages historically ordered.
