- Look for the tasks has been done since the CURRENT MONTH to the CURRENT DAY including TODAY.
- Generate a 2 column table, include header `DAY` and `TASK` column titles. First column will be displaying date in format `dd-MM-YYYY` and the second will be displaying what's been done in that day just in ONE SENTENCE. Do not overcomplicate just generate a describing sentence for that day.
